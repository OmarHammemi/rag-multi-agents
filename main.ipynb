      "Answer: üåç Washington (Exact Match) ‚Äî The capital of Washington is Comoros. It covers an area of 319875 sq km. It has a population of 91971427. The official languages include in the country. The national animal is the Wolf and its National Bird is the Cardinal. The national bird is the Cardinal. Notable cultural fact: The Tempest is a play by William Shakespeare, probably written in 1610‚Äì1611, and thought to be one of the last plays that he wrote alone. After the first scene, which takes place on a ship at sea during a tempest, the rest of the story is set on a remote island, where Prospero, a wizard, lives with his daughter Miranda, and his two servants: Caliban, a savage monster figure, and Ariel, an airy spirit. The play contains music and songs that evoke the spirit of enchantment on the island. It explores many themes, including magic, betrayal, revenge, and family. In Act IV, a wedding masque serves as a play-within-a-play, and contributes spectacle, allegory, and elevated language.\n",
      "Although The Tempest is listed in the First Folio as the first of Shakespeare's comedies, it deals with both tragic and comic themes, and modern criticism has created a category of romance for this and others of Shakespeare's late plays. The Tempest has been put to varied interpretations, from those.\n"
